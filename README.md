# rocketLandingSimulator
This program simulates landing on the Moon and different planets. In the simulation, the user inputs how much fuel they would like to use. Based on the force of gravity on the target planet, the amount of fuel will generate a velocity and update the altitude of the ship. In order to land successfully, the ship must be within a certain velocity threshold, or else it will crash. In order to reach the next level, the current level must be completed. Created with Python 3.4.7
